## SQL Project

### Overview
This project showcases my **SQL expertise** in data extraction, transformation, and analysis. It involves querying a structured database to **derive business insights, optimize performance, and ensure data accuracy**.

### Key Features
- **Data Type Conversion** – Used `CAST()` to convert data types for calculations and formatting.  
- **Data Formatting** – Applied `TO_CHAR()` to format dates and numbers for better readability.  
- **Ranking & Window Functions** – Implemented `RANK()`, `DENSE_RANK()`, and `ROW_NUMBER()` to analyze ranking-based insights.  
- **Common Table Expressions (CTE)** – Simplified complex queries using **recursive and non-recursive** CTEs.  
- **Aggregations & Grouping** – Leveraged `SUM()`, `COUNT()`, and `GROUP BY` for analytical insights.  

### Tools
